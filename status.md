# Term Name

**Term**: `status`

**Definition**: git status lets you see the state of the working directory and the staging area.

**Example**: you modified a couple of file in your branch but you dont remember which you added already? check the status of your branch with git status command. you will also see which files are tracked by git and which are not. since this does not change anything in your local directory, you can just try it out!

**Code Snippet**: '<git status -s>' gives output in short format; '<git status -v> gives output in longer format
